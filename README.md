# ocf dotfiles

My OCF account desktop rice. It's super janky but it works and it looks decent enough. Probably not going to fix until break

(Oh, btw the `.bashrc_61b` is my instructional account rice for 61b. Didn't know where to put it so here it is)

### How to Install
 <!-- REMEMBER TO EDIT THIS!!! -->
 1. Login to your ocf account in the lab.
 2. Open a terminal and `cd remote`.
 3. `git clone https://github.com/64bitpandas/dotfiles`
 4. `git checkout ocf`
 5. Move all the files from the dotfiles folder into the root remote directory.
 6. The config should automatically apply whenever you login to a new desktop! (To test, `source ./.desktoprc`)

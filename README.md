## For contributors/myself
#### How to contribute:
1. Fork if necessary, then create a new branch from master. **NOTE: NEVER PR FROM ANOTHER BRANCH TO MASTER!!!**
2. Delete this README and rename `EXAMPLE_README.md` to `README.md`.
3. Edit the new README to include all necessary details and screenshots for your configuration. The goal is to make it easy for any user to reproduce your exact setup by simply following instructions.
4. Upload your dotfiles! Remember to include any configs that are outside of `~/.config` and any special instructions for installing them. Also remove any files from `.config` that are not unique to your config (e.g. spotify, vscode, discord...)
5. Add your branch to the directory in the master README.
